NO-Asteroids
============

NO - Means "Nick and Oscar"

Nick and Oscar attempt to make a game like Asteroids within 2 weeks.

Nicks-Branch - Where Nick will work on his machine and commit to before pushing his branch to the master branch.

Oscars-Branch - Where Oscar will work on his machine and commit to before pushing his branch to the master branch.

NOTE: Only one person should be in charge of a scene at a time.  It may be a good idea to have an "Oscar Scene" and a "Nick Scene", that way we won't collide as often.
